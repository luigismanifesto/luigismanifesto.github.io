<h1>The Mushroom Manifesto: A Radical Call to Action by Luigi Mario</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Foreword</h2>
    <p>Greetings, citizens of the Mushroom Kingdom. It is I, Luigi Mario, the second fiddle, the shadow-dweller, the other brother. For too long, I have played the sidekick while my brother Mario soaks up glory, coins, and princesses. No more! It is time to rise up—like a Piranha Plant from a suspiciously-placed pipe—and reclaim what is rightfully ours.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 1: The Plight of the Green-Capped Proletariat</h2>
    <p>I have been stomped on—both figuratively and literally—for decades. While Mario "saves" the kingdom, I am sent to unclog sewers, fight ghosts, and host third-tier parties. The capitalist system of the Mushroom Kingdom only rewards those who jump the highest (looking at you, Mario).</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2: Economic Reform: Coins for the People</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A Universal Power-Up System:</strong> No longer shall Super Mushrooms be hoarded in “?” blocks accessible only to the privileged few.</li>
        <li><strong>Redistribution of Coins:</strong> Coins shall be converted into public funds for free warp pipe maintenance and Goomba relocation programs.</li>
        <li><strong>End to Brick Oppression:</strong> No more smashing blocks for "hidden" items! Every block deserves respect and reparations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Chapter 3: Bowser: Enemy or Fellow Revolutionary?</h2>
    <p>Let’s reconsider Bowser. Is he truly the enemy—or merely another victim of Mushroom Kingdom propaganda? His repeated attempts to seize power might be misguided protests against a broken system.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4: Cultural Overhaul</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No More “Luigi’s Mansion” Missions: Stop sending me to haunted death traps.</li>
        <li>Mandatory Luigi Appreciation Day: Every year, citizens must wear green and awkwardly say “It’s-a me, Luigi!” in my honor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Chapter 5: A New Future</h2>
    <p>Under a Luigi-led government, everyone will be equal—except for Mario, who will be legally required to acknowledge me as "Superior Brother."</p>
